# 🚀 Ecosystem-in-a-Box: The DevEx Revenue Playbook

**Bridging the gap between Technical Innovation and Business Value.**

This repository is a comprehensive Go-To-Market (GTM) framework for Developer Tools. It combines a **Strategic Playbook** for scaling startup ecosystems with a **Technical Simulator** that quantifies the financial impact of Developer Experience (DevEx).

## 🧠 The Philosophy
As a former founder who has scaled products across 4 countries and the US/APAC markets, I’ve seen millions in marketing spend wasted because the "Developer Funnel" was leaky. 

Currently pursuing a **Dual MS in AI and Business Analytics**, I built this project to move DevRel from "community sentiment" to "measurable revenue acceleration."

## 🛠️ Project Components
1. **The Playbook:** A structured guide on GTM strategy, developer onboarding audits, and community scaling.
2. **The Simulator (Live Demo):** https://dev-ecosystem-playbook.vercel.app — An interactive web game that "stress tests" a product's developer readiness.
3. **The Analytics Engine:** Mathematical models (LaTeX) to calculate CAC Efficiency and Support Deflection ROI.

## 📈 The Analytics of DevEx
We don't just track GitHub Stars. We track the **Cost of Friction**.

### 1. CAC Efficiency (The Cost of Friction)
$$L_{v} = CAC \times (1 - \frac{A_{rate}}{A_{target}})$$

### 2. Support Deflection ROI
$$S_{saved} = (V_{total} \times D_{rate}) \times C_{ticket}$$

## 🚀 Getting Started
* **For Founders:** Read the `/playbook` to audit your GTM strategy.
* **For DevRel Leads:** Use the `/simulator` to benchmark your product's onboarding friction.
* **For Data Analysts:** Explore `/analytics` to see the logic behind the Revenue Impact models.
